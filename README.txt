You will find a description of the different files and folders below. The first part is composed of the codes used to obtain each figure. The second part describes the codes present in each folder. Don’t forget to add the correct directory in main Julia or Matlab files. Most of the codes take a relatively long amount of time to be run. The data generated by Julia codes are too heavy to be uploaded in the Github, it is the reason why data.dat files are removed. If you are interested in these data, please contact us. Since we use uniform distributions to produce variability in parameter spaces, it is likely that you might not have the exact same results. However, the conclusion remains the same.
